Observational Study :
Salmonella Typhi Data Analysis System 2024
○ Developed a comprehensive data analysis system using real-world data from LRG Hospital, focusing on
observational studies of 30,000 patients to identify new emerging patterns of Salmonella Typhi.
○ Aimed to improve patient care and treatment outcomes for Salmonella Typhi infections.
○ Utilized a wide array of libraries including pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, scipy.stats,
plotly.express, and sklearn.
○ Implemented data cleaning and preprocessing using pandas, statistical analysis with scipy.stats, and
anomaly detection using IsolationForest.
○ Created interactive visualizations with plotly.express for insightful data presentation.
○ Performed machine learning tasks such as regression analysis with sklearn.linear model, achieving
significant predictions with metrics like r2 score and mean squared error.
○ Conducted hypothesis testing using ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests to derive actionable insights for
healthcare advancements
